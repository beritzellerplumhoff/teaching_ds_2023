The files in this folder were created for the exercise on 23rd June 2023 on the topics of visualizing the updating of weights in MLPs during backpropagation, principal component analysis and k-means clustering. The notebook builds upon the notebook(s) from the previous week(s). The _empty file contains the empty file for the students to work with during the exercise and fill in, while the other file contains the solution. Open questions contained in the notebook are usually answered during discussions in the exercise. The file ismetal_df.pkl was obtained after using [matminer](https://hackingmaterials.lbl.gov/matminer/#) to load the dataset matbench_expt_is_metal and featurize the dataframe following the description in [this lesson](https://workshop.materialsproject.org/lessons/08_ml_matminer/matminer-notes/) of the materials project workshop. The dataset is based on [Zhuo et al., 2018](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/pdf/10.1021/acs.jpclett.8b00124)<a name="cite_ref-1"></a>[<sup>[1]</sup>](#cite_note-1). The code in the NN_vis.py file, which is used to display the neural network architecture, was taken from the entries of Milo and Oliver Wilken [here](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/29888233/how-to-visualize-a-neural-network/37366154#37366154), and is available under a [CC BY-SA 3.0 license](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/).
