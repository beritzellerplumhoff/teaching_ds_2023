The files in this folder were created for the exercise on 9th June 2023 on the topic of classification by means of artificial neural networks, building upong the notebook from the previous week. For this week, scroll towards the bottom of the notebook to find the newest exercises. 
The _empty file contains the empty file for the students to work with during the exercise and fill in, while the other file contains the solution. Open questions contained in the notebook are usually answered during discussions in the exercise. The file ismetal_df.pkl was obtained after using [matminer](https://hackingmaterials.lbl.gov/matminer/#) to load the dataset matbench_expt_is_metal and featurize the dataframe following the description in [this lesson](https://workshop.materialsproject.org/lessons/08_ml_matminer/matminer-notes/) of the materials project workshop. The dataset is based on [Zhuo et al., 2018](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/pdf/10.1021/acs.jpclett.8b00124)<a name="cite_ref-1"></a>[<sup>[1]</sup>](#cite_note-1).
